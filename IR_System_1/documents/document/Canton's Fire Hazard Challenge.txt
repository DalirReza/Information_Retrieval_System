The mountain town of Canton, perched at 6,000 feet, is enveloped by dense underbrush and towering pine trees. After six years of drought, this vegetation poses a significant fire threat. To mitigate this risk, plans are in place to remove thousands of trees and tons of underbrush over the next five years, costing at least $3 million. The project will first clear the brush, followed by the trees, creating a nonflammable buffer around the 4,000 residents. While many locals welcome the initiative, some express concerns about increased traffic and the potential for off-roaders to misuse the cleared areas. “I just hope this work protects our homes,” said Sarah, a longtime resident.
