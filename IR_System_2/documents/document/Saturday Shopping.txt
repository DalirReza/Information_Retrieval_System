Sara Johnson, a 32-year-old resident of Pasadena, decided to do some shopping on Saturday morning. Living at 1234 Maple Avenue since 2015, she is married to David, and they have a daughter named Lily, who is four years old. At 9 a.m., Sara climbed into her 2010 gray Honda Civic and drove to Barget, a nearby department store.

With a special sale underway, she picked up a new coffee maker for $49.99, down from the usual $69.99, paying with her credit card. On her way home, she stopped at FreshMart for a loaf of whole grain bread for $2.50. Sara returned home by 10:15 a.m., excited to surprise David and Lily with a delicious brunch.
