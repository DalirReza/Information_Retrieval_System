the mountain town of canton perched at 6000 feet is enveloped by dense underbrush and towering pine trees after six years of drought this vegetation poses a significant fire threat to mitigate this risk plans are in place to remove thousands of trees and tons of underbrush over the next five years costing at least 3 million the project will first clear the brush followed by the trees creating a nonflammable buffer around the 4000 residents while many locals welcome the initiative some express concerns about increased traffic and the potential for offroaders to misuse the cleared areas i just hope this work protects our homes said sarah a longtime resident
