jessica like many renters is growing weary of the rental lifestyle one of her biggest frustrations is the everincreasing rent every year without fail my landlord raises the rent by about seven percent she said exasperated it feels like im stuck in a neverending cycle where my paycheck just cant keep up but its not just the rent hikes that have her contemplating a change its also the constant turnover of neighbors

just when i get used to one set of neighbors they move out and someone new moves in jessica lamented my last neighbor was a night owl who would blast music at 2 am i had to knock on her door more times than i can count now the new family next door has a toddler who loves to scream at the top of his lungs its like a neverending concert

yet not all renters share jessicas frustrations mark a recent graduate has a more positive outlook on his living situation ive been fortunate with my neighbors he said smiling my roommate is a graphic designer and we often collaborate on projects our nextdoor neighbors are quiet and keep to themselves which i appreciate plus the family down the hall is super friendly they always invite us over for dinner

attitudes toward renting can vary significantly while jessica sees the chaotic nature of her living situation as overwhelming mark finds joy in the camaraderie of his neighbors renting can feel like a gamble he mused you never know what youre going to get but ive learned to focus on the positives i love the flexibility that comes with renting like being able to move if i need to

for some a roof over their heads is the ultimate goal and theyre grateful for any space that meets their needs however others like jessica may find themselves nitpicking every little detail wishing for something different whether its the noise level or the everincreasing rent the experiences of renters are as varied as the individuals who occupy these spaces
