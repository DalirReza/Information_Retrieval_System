the coastal town of lozano beach is facing a significant decision regarding weekly home rentals during the summer months this rental practice could be a financial windfall for homeowners potentially generating substantial income for the city through a 15percent surcharge on rental earnings this can be a boon to our coffers stated rick brown the city manager in the summer homeowners can bring in 2000 a week or more

however the prospect of resuming these rentals stirs up memories of past issues the city prohibited weekly rentals a decade ago due to escalating problems often multiple families would crowd into small homes leading to excessive noise overflowing trash and vehicles parked on lawns complaints from residents frequently required police intervention straining community resources

in light of current budget constraints city officials are reconsidering their ban a community meeting is scheduled next week to discuss potential regulations including a proposed 200 fine for homeowners who violate noise ordinances some officials argue that the disruptions caused by inconsiderate renters outweigh any financial benefits while others believe tighter regulations could allow for a balanced approach to this lucrative opportunity
